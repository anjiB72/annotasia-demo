## Tasks

### Task 1

Create a new custom annotation that validates that a Users postcode is a valid UK postcode.

A UK postcode is an alphanumeric code that's six to eight characters long, including a space, and is divided into two parts:
      
Outward code.

The first part of the postcode, which identifies the town or district. It's usually two to four characters long. For example, in the postcode NW3, the "NW" indicates the northwestern part of London.
      
Inward code.

The second part of the postcode, which identifies the sector, delivery point, or individual address within the town or district. It's always three characters long and starts with a number.
